### April 2nd, 2019 [https://launch.visualstudio.com/](https://launch.visualstudio.com/)
Visual Studio 2019 is here! On April 2nd we will broadcast a full day of awesome Visual Studio 2019 technical content to celebrate the launch and get you up to speed with all the new features. This repo contains creative and technical content for running a local launch event or watch party in your community as well as information on how to syndicate the broadcast on your own sites. 

If you are interested in running a local event or watch party between April 2 and June 30, please make sure you let us know by filling out this survey: [www.surveymonkey.com/r/VS2019Launch](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VS2019Launch). We will advertize your event on the [local events page](https://aka.ms/VS2019-Local-Events) and support you with swag (while supplies last).

# Event Guidelines
You are free to organize a watch party to view the online broadcast live and/or organize a presentation, workshop, or hack-a-thon anytime until June 30. The technical content needs to be Visual Studio 2019 related. Topics can include but aren't limited to: Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac latest versions, .NET, C++, DevOps, cloud development with Visual Studio & Azure.  

# Technical Content
The `Technical` folder contains the technical content from the event. Relevant demos are linked to in the decks. 

# Creative & Social Copy 
The `Creative` folder contains creative banners and images you can use to advertise the Visual Studio 2019 launch and your local events. We will have more images and a variety of sizes to choose from soon. You may use these banners to advertize the main event itself, or your local events in your community. You may add your local meetup name, location and dates to these images. You may not change the Visual Studio 2019 launch event branding.
